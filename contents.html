	The relationship between creativity and business has always been an uneasy one. This chapter introduces the reader to the business concepts of organizational creativity as a business practice and creative accountability as a corporate mandate.
	<span class="br"></span>
	What are the responsibilities of an employee in a creative company and what are the responsibilities of the employer?
	Here you learn that creativity is a business attribute just like accounting &ndash; it can be taught, managed and improved upon, just like your golf game.
	Organizational creativity can also be quantified and rated. As a result, its impact on a company's culture becomes evolutionary, rather than revolutionary.
